Getting Started
---------------

* All assignments will be written in C++. The assignments should ease you in.

* The assignments make use of the cross-platform, open source Qt development environment,
which comes with a great IDE. Install the open source version
of the Qt environment: <https://www.qt.io/download-open-source>
(At the time of writing, version 5.11 is the newest version. Any 5.x
version should work.) This installer, by default, includes all versions of
Qt. This is unnecessary and takes a huge amount of space.
Install only the most recent version (e.g. Qt 5.11) and the Qt Creator IDE.
On Windows, also install the MingW compiler.

    * Mac users can install more easily with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install qt` and `brew cask install qt-creator`.
    * Ubuntu Linux users can install more easily via `apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtcreator`.

* Download each assignment. Inside each folder there is a
file named `<project>.pro`. This should launch the Qt Creator development
environment (IDE).

* Build and run the code. Make your changes. Write a `Notes.txt`. Hand it in.
